Review your schema and identify any potential redundancies or violations of normalization principles.

Adjust your database design to achieve 3NF
First Normal Form (1NF): Ensure each column contains atomic values, and each record is unique.
Second Normal Form (2NF): Achieve 1NF and ensure all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
Third Normal Form (3NF): Achieve 2NF and ensure all attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key.
